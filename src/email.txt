Hi Tim,

When putting together the mock page, I made some tweaks to the components. Shouldn't affect how you call them, expect:

Breaking Changes on how to import the header:
  from
    import NewHeader from '....src/components/NewHeader';
  to
    import { NodeHeader } from '....src/components/NodeHeader';
  SO BOTH NAME CHANGE (from NewHeader to NodeHeader) AND CURLY BRACE CHANGE

Possible breaking change on the table:
  in Table.css:
    from
      .table {width: 1256px;}
    to
      .table {width: 100%;}`
    Now needs your own parent container to restrain width
    e.g.
    .containerForWholePageExceptNodeHeaderWhichGoesAcross {
      width: 95%;
      max-width: 1256px;
    }

New behavior of CardGrid:
  If no numCol is specified, will response to screen width and wraps around.
  Also provide your own parent container to restrain width, otherwise may display 5 columns

Some dead code I want to delete but don't want to mess with your work:
  In TableWithExpandableRow/Tr/Tr.js, there'are 2 lines of dead code that bothers me, I want to delete them but fear that you already made changes in that file, so I'll refrain until you finish working on the table
